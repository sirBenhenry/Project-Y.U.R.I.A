# Architecture (High Level)

Y.U.R.I.A is organized around a core orchestrator and modular integrations.

## Core Components
- Orchestrator: routes tasks and manages tool calls
- Integrations: email, calendar, files, web services, smart home, devices
- Memory (optional): durable preferences and user context
- Logging: action history and audit trail

## Notes
This document is intentionally high level and will evolve as the project becomes concrete.
