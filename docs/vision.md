# Vision

Y.U.R.I.A is a personal project focused on building a capable assistant that operates beyond chat.

The goal is a system that can understand tasks, plan them, and execute them through real integrations such as calendar, email, files, web services, smart home, and connected devices.

## Principles
- Integration first: actions and outcomes matter more than conversation
- Clear boundaries: permissioned access, confirmations for risky actions
- Modular design: connectors should be swappable and testable
- Local first where possible: prefer privacy and reliability
- Traceability: keep logs so actions can be reviewed and trusted

## Status
Early stage. Planning and prototyping.
