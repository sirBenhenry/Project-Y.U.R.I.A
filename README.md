## About

**Y.U.R.I.A** is built to help you do things, not just talk about them.  
It is designed to work across both the digital world (web services and computing hardware) and the physical world (smart-home and connected machines), enabling reliable task handling with real permissions and real outcomes.

The codename **Yggdrasil** reflects the project’s core idea, a single structure that links many separate “worlds.” In practice, **Y.U.R.I.A** acts as the connective layer between your digital life and the physical devices around you. It unifies tools, services, and hardware into one assistant you can reliably delegate to.
