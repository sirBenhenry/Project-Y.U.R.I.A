## About

**Y.U.R.I.A** is built to help you *do* things—not just talk about them.  
It is designed to work across both the digital world (web services and computing hardware) and the physical world (smart-home and connected machines), enabling reliable task handling with real permissions and real outcomes.

The codename **Yggdrasil** reflects the project’s core idea: a single structure that links many separate “worlds.” In practice, **Y.U.R.I.A** acts as the connective layer between your digital life and the physical devices around you—unifying tools, services, and hardware into one assistant you can reliably delegate to.
